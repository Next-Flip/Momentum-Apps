## Contribution
This is a big task, and I welcome all contributors, especially developers interested in animations and graphics. Fork the repository, create a pull request, and I will review your edits.

## Known Bugs
1. When clicking the Catalog, I get an "out of memory" error.
   - This has been addressed but may still occur. If it does, just restart the app.
2. The app file is corrupted.
   - It's likely there was an error parsing the data. Restart the app and wait until the green LED light turns off after downloading the app before exiting the view.
3. The app is stuck on "receiving".
   - Restart your Flipper Zero with your WiFi Devboard plugged in.
